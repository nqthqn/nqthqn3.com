We conversed about IoT, MIDI, Go-lang, and a few more small app ideas. We will be starting a few projects on our [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/hack-night) page soon.

An electrical engineer with 35+ years of experience demoed a prototype of a breath powered MIDI instrument. We had the Eugene go-lang community leader demo a particle simulation he wrote in Go for display in Paraview.

We had a few new faces â€” Warm welcome to all of you!
