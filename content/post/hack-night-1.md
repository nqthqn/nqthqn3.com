Our inaugural hack night took place Wednesday night from 5-7pm with 5 developers. We discussed frontend development and shared resources. 

 - [The State of JS](http://stateofjs.com/)
 - [Vue JS](https://vuejs.org/)
 - [Ghost Blog](https://ghost.org/)
 - [Eugene Tech Slack](http://eugenetech.org/slack)

This week we mostly had a fun discussion. People shared a few app ideas and open source projects that could use some TLC.

Also, the pizza was good.
