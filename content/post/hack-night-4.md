This hack night was sparsely attended due to the weather. I should say we discussed IRC, blocking javascript on the web and someone brought a [Novena Laptop](https://www.crowdsupply.com/sutajio-kosagi/novena).

I spent most of the evening typing away in [Elm lang](http://elm-lang.org/). Thanks to all who made it! It was fun have some [EUGLUG](http://euglug.org/)ers (Is that what you are called?) in attendance.
