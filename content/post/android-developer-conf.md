20 free t-shirts, 10 tutorials and a couple keynotes later I feel a step closer to becoming an android developer.

I plan to take this [udacity course](https://www.udacity.com/course/developing-android-apps--ud853) when I get home. Hopefully I'll be sharing an Android app in the play store soon! Here is a list of some of the new tech I've been learning about at AnDevCon,

 - [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
 - [bugsnag](https://bugsnag.com/)
 - [branch](https://branch.io/)
 - [google vr](https://developers.google.com/vr/)
 - [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

It will be interesting moving from Python to Java to pursue native android app development. I'll be typing many more words! Oh boy. IntelliJ seems cool. I like how "option enter enter" automatically imports.

This is Day 2. I'll post again tomorrow.
