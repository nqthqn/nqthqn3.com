**I exist in the paradox of distracted focus.** Highly focused distraction. My curiosity causes me to learn in an asynchronous way. I complete 40% of task A then move to task B. I'll complete 10% then move back to task A and wrap it up.

**This non-linear way is a bit dizzying** and leaves one quite unsatisfied. I think I need to start completing the tasks one by one. At least, in some cases.

When I want to learn something I obsess over it. For days on end I will wake up, dig in, tune out and then go to bed dreaming about what I've been learning. First thing in the morning I'll be up and at it.

I resonate with the struggle to stay on task. *â€” Ria*

The internet provides endless resources for learning a given topic. There is always a new article, podcast, video, tutorial, book, etc. to add to my list. 

A future project might be to graph the undulations of learning. I'll need to define some measures and track data on myself. Maybe I'll learn [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) by programming **a tracking app for learning new things**. I'll need an app to track my progress learning Elm though.

Hmm...
