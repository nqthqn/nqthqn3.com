Our second ever hack night 🎉  was focused more on backend development and devops. I shared a short demo of a multi-site https reverse proxy I was working on using node. We had a custom PHP site demo (from an up and coming developer) and another demo of a golang app that deploys and configures docker applications, sets up sub-domains and fetches certificates from [letsencrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) 😮 (I think I got that right). 

### Other topics 😬 🤓

 - rockets in the desert 
 - automated chicken coups
 - video live streaming chickens
 - docker infrastructure
 - golang
 - custom PHP/MySQL 
 - Django
 - developer career paths
 - NoSQL (MongoDB)
 - azerty, qwerty, dvorak, oh my!
 
We may start an open source tech article syndication/archive web app. We may attempt world domination. 🤖

Oh, and we ate lots of domi**NO**s pizza. 🍕

The next two hack nights are cancelled due to Thanksgiving 🍗 and a conference. If someone is interested in hosting the hack night of November 30th, let me know.
