I've received feedback from my recruiter. I will not be flying down to mountain view for onsite interviewing. I need to learn how to work through a conceptual solution before diving into coding. 

Honestly, it was a pretty nerve racking process â€” more so than it needed to be. I'll be ready next time! Onward and upwards! Also, side note, 60% of current googlers did not get in on their first try. So that's encouraging I suppose.

I would highly recommend attempting a google technical phone screening. It was fun studying for it and it is certainly not as scary as I thought it would be.
