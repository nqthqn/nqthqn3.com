> **Hack Nights** are a time set aside each week for coders and anyone generally interested in technology to gather and hack, work on homework, or just hang out. Presentations are infrequent and short.

Tonight we had some lovely IPAs and stouts. Folks worked through algorithms. One gentleman worked on a postcard ordering webapp. I planned to work on my side project "[make domain names](https://github.com/lumastories/makedomainnames)" but ended up being a [chatty cathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatty_Cathy). I caught a few conversations surrounding go-lang, api design and usage of python for scientific purposes. [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), [jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) ftw!

We had a few new faces - Welcome to all of you! If you have not yet joined the slack group you can get an invite [here](https://slackin-eglwbetqxf.now.sh/) and join the `#hack-night` channel.

I'm excited to see this group grow, mingle, mesh and produce. I know we've all got things we want to build and accomplish. Hopefully everyone was inspired tonight.

I'm sensing there may be a sub group forming for people interested in algorithms. Or maybe we all just want (new) jobs and like puzzles?

We also did another google glass demo. So that was fun...
