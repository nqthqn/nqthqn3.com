Absolutely love this tune. Shakey shares the story of how he got his stage name.

> One of the most talented Austin songwriters and musicians, Shakey Graves, plays a badass tune in the bottom of a storm ditch on a crisp February afternoon in East Austin. Surrounded by tunnels, trains and grassy knolls make for a stirring rendition of his song "Late July"
