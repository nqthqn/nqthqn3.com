I just wrapped up my google **t**echnical **p**hone **s**creening this morning. My advice? Ease in to the problem you are given. Don't start coding right away and verify that you understand the requirements. I had to start over — but with some nudges from my interviewer I was able to get 99% of the way to an optimal solution.

Anyway, now I am working through my solution and calling on `assert()` — my new best friend.

> Need positive affirmations while you code? `assert(True)` is the answer.

Have a lovely day! And remember - the tortoise wins!
