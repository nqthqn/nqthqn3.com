Go [RSVP](https://www.meetup.com/eugenewebdev/events/236974382/). We should have some fun! I've got a little over a month to prepare for this. If I don't procrastinate you will be in for a fun talk. If I do, well, they have pizza and beer! You can't lose!


_Update (March 21, 2017):_ I've begun putting talk resources in my [talks](https://github.com/nqthqn/talks) repo.
