Listening to wordless music helps me focus. My goal as a programmer is to enter into a state of flow. I use pomodoros, music and touch typing. Oh - and ample amounts of tea. So here's a list of good listens, thanks @daved, mentor, friend and business partner.

# El Ten Eleven
Very organic ambient music. Harmonics on the guitar. Love it. Great drumming. A little hypnotic. 

# Helios
Light airy. The sun is peaking through the clouds and this music goes great with this enviornment.

# Tortoise
Very nice mixes. Love the panning and stereo interplay. Activates my right and left brain. I love it! Nice dynamics.

# The Octopus Project
Glitchy, driving, nice builds, good mix between traditional and electronic. Very driving and rythmic. Reminds me a lot of mutemath - the older stuff.

# Astronauts etc.
Groove, light. Easy to listen to and bob your head. Has words, but mixed in well so you can ignore them. Maybe?

# Stars Of The Lid
Drones, atmospheric. I really like this one. This can get weird real fast, so take it easy.

# Elskavon
Great ambience. Lots of nice atmospheres. Very light and minimal.


# Solar Fields
Driving electronica. Synthy.

# Kye Kye
Really enjoy this indie atmospheric artist. Her voice is like honey on an orchestra.
