Last Wednesday we had a good get together of great grinning geeks, golly... ok enough with the alliterations. We had a DevOps engineer in attendance who demoed some sweet visual regression testing. I shared my [great grid making machine](https://runelm.io/c/xvm) and spoke about the Elm architecture.

A few folks got to try out google glass and google daydream. One productive hacker worked in the back attempting to connect his Raspberry Pi to the guest wifi network.

We had a couple new faces â€” Welcome, welcome. Hope to see you all next week for more creativity and [geeking out](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=geeking%20out).
